# Escape_The_Dungeon
game assignment for O.O.P. semester 2 year 2

 Overview:
 Design and code a game in processing using what I've learnt so far.
 game needs to:
 -look good,  
 -have multiple modes/screens,
 -have functionality
 -progression/powerups
 -have classes
 -load from text files
  
  My Game:
  I've designed a 2D maze-based dungeon escape game.
  Based on the difficulty you choose you have a varied amount of lives and time to escape.
  All sprites were designed and drawn by me.
  The map/maze was textured by me.
  The main character must find his way out of the dungeon, fighting enemies as he goes.
  There are also pickups to increase attack, armour and health scattered throughout the dungeon.
  Text files provide the co-ordinates for the collision walls, enemies and pickups based on the original map layout I designed.
  I added a soundtrack during gameplay, and a clock sound to tell the player they have 20 seconds left to find the exit
  The fight sequences are turn based. 
  The attacks are determined by taking the attack points of the player/enemy and subracting a percentage based on the armour rating of defendent
  Also attack points depends on the attack you choose and whether or not you hit or miss
  Added screens for the main menu, game over and ending scenarios
  
  CONTROLS:
  -WSAD buttons for movement
  -LEFT CLICK and ENTER for fight scenes
  -numbers to select difficulty
